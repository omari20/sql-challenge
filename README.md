## About the Project

### Introduction
This project creates a database of employees in a company along with information that relates to their employment. The source data are stored in the data directory.

#### Schema Definition
The first step in the process was to define the schema; firstly I used an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to give a visual representation of the relationships. I then write this out in query form, defining value lengths of column and constraints. 

### Data Analysis
Using SQL, analysis of the data set is performed.
